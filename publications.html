FEEDBACK is a SOFIA (Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy)
legacy program dedicated to study the interaction of massive stars
with their environment. It performs a survey of 11 galactic high mass
star-forming regions in the 158 &mu;m (1.9 THz) line of [C II] and the 63 &mu;m
(4.7 THz) line of [O I]. We employ the 14 pixel Low Frequency Array and 7
pixel High Frequency Array upGREAT heterodyne instrument to spectrally
resolve (0.24 MHz) these far-infrared fine structure lines. With
a total observing time of 96h, we will cover ~6700 arcmin<sup>2</sup> at 14.1"
angular resolution for the [C II] line and 6.3" for the [O I] line. The
observations started in spring 2019 (Cycle 7). Our aim is to understand
the dynamics in regions dominated by different feedback processes from
massive stars such as stellar winds, thermal expansion, and radiation
pressure, and to quantify the mechanical energy injection and radiative
heating efficiency. This is an important science topic because feedback
of massive stars on their environment regulates the physical conditions
and sets the emission characteristics in the interstellar medium
(ISM), influences the star formation activity through molecular cloud
dissolution and compression processes, and drives the evolution of the
ISM in galaxies. The [C II] line provides the kinematics of the gas and
is one of the dominant cooling lines of gas for low to moderate densities
and UV fields. The [O I] line traces warm and high-density gas, excited
in photodissociations regions with a strong UV field or by shocks. The
source sample spans a broad range in stellar characteristics from single
OB stars, to small groups of O stars, to rich young stellar clusters, to
ministarburst complexes. It contains well-known targets such as Aquila,
the Cygnus X region, M16, M17, NGC7538, NGC6334, Vela, and W43 as well as
a selection of H II region bubbles, namely RCW49, RCW79, and RCW120. These
[C II] maps, together with the less explored [O I] 63 &mu;m line, provide
an outstanding database for the community. They will be made publically
available and will trigger further studies and follow-up observations.

Radiative and mechanical feedback of massive stars regulates star formation and galaxy evolution. Positive feedback triggers the creation of new stars by collecting dense shells of gas, while negative feedback disrupts star formation by shredding molecular clouds. Although key to understanding star formation, their relative importance is unknown. Here, we report velocity-resolved observations from the SOFIA (Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy) legacy program FEEDBACK of the massive star-forming region RCW 120 in the [CII] 1.9-THz fine-structure line, revealing a gas shell expanding at 15 km/s. Complementary APEX (Atacama Pathfinder Experiment) CO J=3-2 345-GHz observations exhibit a ring structure of molecular gas, fragmented into clumps that are actively forming stars. Our observations demonstrate that triggered star formation can occur on much shorter time scales than hitherto thought (&lt;0.15 million years), suggesting that positive feedback operates on short time periods.

We unveil the stellar wind-driven shell of the luminous massive star-forming region of RCW 49 using SOFIA FEEDBACK observations of the [C II] 158 &mu;m line. The complementary data set of the <sup>12</sup>CO and <sup>13</sup>CO J = 3-2 transitions is observed by the APEX telescope and probes the dense gas toward RCW 49. Using the spatial and spectral resolution provided by the SOFIA and APEX telescopes, we disentangle the shell from a complex set of individual components of gas centered around RCW 49. We find that the shell of radius ~6 pc is expanding at a velocity of 13 km/s toward the observer. Comparing our observed data with the ancillary data at X-ray, infrared, submillimeter, and radio wavelengths, we investigate the morphology of the region. The shell has a well-defined eastern arc, while the western side is blown open and venting plasma further into the west. Though the stellar cluster, which is ~2 Myr old, gave rise to the shell, it only gained momentum relatively recently, as we calculate the shell's expansion lifetime of ~0.27 Myr, making the Wolf-Rayet star WR 20a a likely candidate responsible for the shell's reacceleration.
